Running journal

Upon first read of the instructions my first thoughts were:
-Man, I wish I had a whiteboard
-A "visualization to compare the pitches thrown" is vague
-Need to brush up on what exactly a contour plot is/looks like
-That formula looks complicated (aka math is amazing)


Ok after a few hours of thinking/drawing/some coding here are some more thoughts:
-I'm not positive, but it seems as though the three parts of my contour "triplet" are x=plate_x, y=plate_z, and z = chanceOfHitFunction(x,y)
-Given that assumption, I started trying to find visualization tools that would allow me to represent a contour plot.
-Initially, I was just going to build something in react (And currently that's what I have), but after searching for visualization tools for react, I am slightly hesitant, but alas, this is a prototype, so we can figure out if it is worth exploring.

My first attempt was to utilize 
-https://uber.github.io/react-vis/documentation/welcome-to-react-vis

Which offered up "contour series", but after toying around, I don't think it offers what I need. It allows me to supply x and y values, but pretty sure it is lacking something.

After some googling, I stumbled across plotly.js, it seems like it allows for more customization and the documentation is extensive

-I did some coding just to get the velocity input/slider working

-end of day one

-I took some time away from theory and just focused on some ui things (see ui.jpg)
-Contour type (still not sure how to create this)
-Pitch type avg pie chart(eg: 72% fastball, 36%curveball, etc)
-Pitch Type Hit pct (fb: 20%, cb:30%, etc...)
.

-Okay created pie/bar charts

BREAKTHROUGH!!!!!
-After a few hours of research/youtube, and feeling like I was back in Calc 2
I think I figured out what I wanted to do!

-I was jumping too many steps when trying to graph a contour, when i should have focused on graphing a multi-variable function
-So what i need to do is generate x vector (-1,1) and y vector (1.6,3.4) and then 
calculate hit chances for each point
-And then I think I will overlay the pitches by Bundy and Cobb so we can see where their pitches are going
.
.
.
-Okay just reworked the React JS code so its a little bit more modular
-Also, the way I design the page feels off. Right now I have a split view.
-I tried to overlay both pitchers pitches on the contour plot, but it honestly looked really busy and you couldn't figure much out.
-I am going to take some time and think on ideas for what visualizations/metrics I can display

Summary of process
- I knew I wanted to at least start with a React app because I could spin one of those up really quickly
- I also knew the Github pages process pretty well so I just duped some old code I had
- I definitely needed to research on contour plots/multi-variable functions. I was two classes short of a Math major, I can see those two classes would have probably helped here
- My initial vision of a split view may have been short sighted, but given the timeframe,I wanted to have something to show
- Also, given I am the only one that is building/looking at this thing for the time being, it is difficult to bounce ideas off yourself.
-If I had more time, I would probably want to ask a few more questions or have a conversation about who we think the audience of this "visualization" is, because that would drive what next steps I would take
- Also, given the data you guys have access too, I'm sure there are some cool predictive analytics we could incorporate into the page

-Some features that would be nice would probably be:
1. Have the page accept page params so you would be able to pass the two pitcher ids in
2. On hovering of a point, it would show the pitch info and some averages/aggregations. 
3. A 3d rendering of the pitches, but mainly because that would be cool to build. Also, 
4. Maybe a link to a video of the pitcher pitching could be interesting to see his release. 
-All in all, I am fairly happy with my submission because I can honestly say I had to learn something in order to build this which is exciting.
