## Quick and dirty instructions

### Hit Chance/Contour Plot/Pitch Scatter Plot
- This assumes I did this right :)
- As per the instructions, there is a slider that allows for the user to adjust the velocity/an input field that adjusts the velocity
- The plot will re-render when you update the velocity so give it a second

### Pitch Location By Pitch Type
- This is just a simple plotting of pitch locations assigned to their pitch type
- You can click on the pitch type in the legend to remove that pitch from the plot
- If you double click on a pitch type, it will remove all other pitch types

### Pitch Type Percentage
-Just a pie chart of pitch types
-No interactivity

### Pitch Type Strike Percentage
-This is the percentage of strikes by a pitch type
-No interactivity


#### Welp thats all....
